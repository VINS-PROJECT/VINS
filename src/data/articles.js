      During my internship at Telkom Witel Lampung under the BGES MBB division, I was given the opportunity to work collaboratively with Ignatius Krisna Issaputra on several projects that combined both data analysis and web development a journey that aligned strongly with my personal slogan, #RiseToImpact.
      
      One of our primary tasks was conducting data analysis on Indibiz installations in the Lampung region from January 2023 to June 2024. For this work, we utilized SQL integrated with PHP to process, analyze, and generate meaningful insights from customer and installation data. This experience strengthened my ability to handle real-world datasets and transform them into actionable information.
      Together, we also developed a customer data analysis dashboard called “Kedaton Connect” for the Telkom Akses Kedaton sector. The project followed the Waterfall method as the workflow framework, and we divided the responsibilities into Front-End and Back-End development. Working as a team allowed me to sharpen not only my technical capabilities, but also my collaboration and communication skills in a professional setting.
      
      Beyond technical work, the internship also provided valuable opportunities to understand Telkom Indonesia’s organizational structure, its workflows, and its connections to several parent and supporting companies. This broadened my perspective on how a large-scale telecommunications company operates, bridging the gap between academic theory and real industry practice and becoming a key milestone in my journey to continually Rise To Impact.

      The differences between school life and college life are significant not only in the way we learn, but also in how we think, build habits, and handle responsibilities. During school years, almost everything is structured: fixed schedules, mandatory uniforms, assigned classrooms, and teachers who guide us through every step. The environment is predictable, providing a routine that keeps us on track from day to day. However, everything shifts once we enter college. The freedom is much larger, but so is the responsibility. There are no teachers constantly reminding you about deadlines, no strict schedule that dictates your entire day, and no system that closely monitors whether you study or skip. You decide your pace, your priorities, and the learning strategy that works for you.

School life is also often associated with a lighter atmosphere stable friendships, familiar faces, and activities centered in one place. College, on the other hand, introduces you to people from different backgrounds, new perspectives, and an environment that pushes you to adapt. Assignments and projects are no longer just about grades; they begin to reflect realworld challenges, teamwork, and professional expectations. Every choice whether joining an organization, selecting courses, or taking on a project plays a role in shaping your personal and academic growth.

Ultimately, the biggest difference between school and college lies in personal development. School builds the foundation and routine, while college strengthens independence, critical thinking, and self discovery. School gives us warm memories of togetherness, while college becomes the stage where we begin to understand who we are and what kind of future we want to pursue. Both phases are equally important, and each contributes uniquely to the person we become today.
