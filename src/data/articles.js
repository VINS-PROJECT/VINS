      During my internship at Telkom Witel Lampung under the BGES MBB division, I was given the opportunity to work collaboratively with Ignatius Krisna Issaputra on several projects that combined both data analysis and web development a journey that aligned strongly with my personal slogan, #RiseToImpact.
      
      One of our primary tasks was conducting data analysis on Indibiz installations in the Lampung region from January 2023 to June 2024. For this work, we utilized SQL integrated with PHP to process, analyze, and generate meaningful insights from customer and installation data. This experience strengthened my ability to handle real-world datasets and transform them into actionable information.
      Together, we also developed a customer data analysis dashboard called “Kedaton Connect” for the Telkom Akses Kedaton sector. The project followed the Waterfall method as the workflow framework, and we divided the responsibilities into Front-End and Back-End development. Working as a team allowed me to sharpen not only my technical capabilities, but also my collaboration and communication skills in a professional setting.
      
      Beyond technical work, the internship also provided valuable opportunities to understand Telkom Indonesia’s organizational structure, its workflows, and its connections to several parent and supporting companies. This broadened my perspective on how a large-scale telecommunications company operates, bridging the gap between academic theory and real industry practice and becoming a key milestone in my journey to continually Rise To Impact.
